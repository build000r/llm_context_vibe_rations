Integration Between Frontend and Backend:
1. API Integration:
   - Use frontend services to interact with backend APIs, maintaining separation of concerns.
2. Data Synchronization:
   - Keep frontend data in sync with the backend.
3. Error Propagation:
   - Propagate backend errors to the frontend with user-appropriate messages.
